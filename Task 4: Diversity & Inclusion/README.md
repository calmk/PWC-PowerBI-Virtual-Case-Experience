# Problem Statement

- **Problem:** Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress.
- **Objective**:
    - Define proper KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover
    - Create a visualization for the HR manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance indicators(KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
    - Define some root causes of their slow progress in improving gender balance at the executive management level might be
    - Allows for minimal interaction.
   
# Data Sourcing

### Data Cleaning

Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in Power Query as follows:

- Unnecessary columns were removed
- Unnecessary rows were filtered
- Each of the columns in the table was validated to have the correct data type

### Data Transformation

- For easy observing and analyzing, the extracted text had been applied for those columns: `Job Level after FY21 promotions`, `Job Level after FY20 promotions`
    - Extracted Text After Delimiter = `Table.TransformColumns(#"Extracted Text After Delimiter1", {{"Job Level before FY20 promotions", each Text.AfterDelimiter(_, "-"), type text}})`

# Data Modeling

After the dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to be modeled. Because the dataset is just included one table, the Data Modeling is nothing much to modify
- `Measure` was created to store all DAX measures for ensuring the organization

# Data Visualization

Data visualization for the dataset was done in Microsoft Power BI Desktop, the dashboard includes three main dashboards and three tooltip pages:

- HR Overview
- Performance
- Hiring & Promotion

### Dashboard Type

Dashboard by the level of detail: **Operational dashboard**

Dashboard by use-case: **Exploratory**

Target audience: **Human Resource Manager, Analyst**

### Key Performance Indicators and Metrics:

**About HR Overview:**

- Number of employees, leavers
- Number of promotions and hiring in FY20
- Average Performance
- Age distribution
- Nationality distribution
- Job-level distribution
- Time type distribution

**About Performance:**

- Average Performance of gender, leavers

### Measures

- **Calculated measures:**
    - Turnover Rate = `Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('HR dataset'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR dataset','HR dataset'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes")),Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('HR dataset'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR dataset','HR dataset'[In base group for turnover FY20]="Y"))+Calculate(distinctcount('HR dataset'[Employee ID]),Filter('HR dataset',NOT('HR dataset'[Department @01.07.2020]=BLANK()))),2))`
    - #newhire = `CALCULATE(COUNT('HR dataset'[New hire FY20?]),KEEPFILTERS('HR dataset'[New hire FY20?] = "Yes"))`
    - #PromoteFY20 =
    
    `VAR promote = CALCULATE(COUNT('HR dataset'[Promotion in FY20?]),'HR dataset'[Promotion in FY20?] = "Y")
    Return` 
    
    `IF(ISBLANK(promote),0,promote)`
    
- **Format measures**
    - Welcome text = 
    `VAR Hour = HOUR(NOW())
    VAR Greeting = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        Hour >= 0 && Hour < 5, "Good Night",
        Hour >= 5 && Hour < 12, "Good Morning",
        Hour >= 12 && Hour < 18, "Good Afternoon",
        Hour >= 18 && Hour < 24, "Good Evening"
    )
    RETURN
    Greeting & " " & "Manager!"`
    - Performance Rating % =
        
        `VAR __BASELINE_VALUE = SUM('HR dataset'[FY20 Performance Rating])
        VAR __VALUE_TO_COMPARE = SUM('HR dataset'[FY19 Performance Rating])
        VAR change = DIVIDE(__VALUE_TO_COMPARE - __BASELINE_VALUE, __BASELINE_VALUE)
        RETURN
        		IF(NOT ISBLANK(__VALUE_TO_COMPARE), 
        		SWITCH(TRUE(),
                change <= 0,"▼"  & " " & FORMAT(change*-1,"percent"),
                change > 0, "▲" & " " & FORMAT(change,"percent")))`

# Analysis and Insights

The purpose of this dashboard is to serve as self-exploratory for managers, but I still note some highlighted points that I recognize that some root causes of their slow progress in improving gender balance at the executive management level might be below:

- Employees who were promoted twice within two years had very low-performance ratings, while those who left had higher ratings.
- According to the data, it appears that a significant portion of employees has been stagnating in their current job level for more than two years, despite working diligently. Promotions have not been forthcoming, female directors, in particular, require more time to be nominated as executives compared to their male counterparts.
- There is a significant gender imbalance in the distribution of new hires and promotions for executive positions, despite the fact that these female directors perform better.
- A potential factor contributing to the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level is that the performance evaluations for promotion at management levels may not be entirely objective and honest. This could result in qualified female candidates being overlooked for executive positions, despite their superior performance compared to their male counterparts.
