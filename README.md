# PWC PowerBI Virtual Case Experience

This repository displays the process and outcomes of the tasks completed during theÂ [PwC Switzerland PowerBI Virtual Case Experience](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/a87GpgE6tiku7q3gu/Power%20BI?ref=W5vwWAjutTpHbEraC) developed by Forage. The virtual internship is created to simulate work in the Digital Accelerator team at PwC Switzerland and leverages Power BI.

All of these .pbix files and insights were my personal submissions for this program, except for the data files which were assigned by PwC Switzerland.
